## OUAIve 

OUAIve is a sample player and that's all. You choose the sample via the menu. You press play or you trig him at your convenience.
If he is in a good mood, he will remind the sample that you selected.

## ChUTE 

ChUTE is a space/strange trigger based on the free fall and bouncing of an object. 
You can change the drop altitude between 10cm and 3m, the gravity in between the moon's one and neptune's one. Earth is the default. 
And you can adjust the C.O.R. meaning the coefficient of restitution.
Outputs provide a gate based on downside movments, the relative tension regarding the altitude ALT and TOP which exposes the tops of the rebounds.

The repository is based on development branch of Rack.
